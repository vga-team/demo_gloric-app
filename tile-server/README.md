# Tile Server

This directory contains a shell script that runs a tile server for the processed tilesets. The software [mbtileserver](https://github.com/consbio/mbtileserver) is used and required to be installed before running the shell script. In the shell script, it assumes there is a `mbtileserver` executable in the current directory.  
After processed the tilesets and installed [mbtileserver](https://github.com/consbio/mbtileserver), just run `sh serve.sh` to start the server.
